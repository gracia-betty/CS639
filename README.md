        - Color schemes.
        - Typography styles.
        - Elevation effects.
        - Layout configurations.

- The implementation involves leveraging:
        - Custom shapes for visual elements.
        - Motion design principles for fluid interactions.
        - Traditional Android SDK classes for functionality and behavior.
