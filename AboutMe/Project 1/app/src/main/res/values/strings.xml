        Hi, I am Gracia Betty Jebaraj Daniel.
        I am a Graduate Student studying MS in Computer Science at Pace University.
        I did my bachelors degree in Computer Science Engineering from KCG College of Technology in India.
        I was born and brought up in Chennai, India. I completed my bachelors in June 2023 and I started my masters immediately.
        During my bachelors I did an internship with IBM where I developed an Inventory Management App and hosted it on IBM cloud.
        I am passionate about Web and App development and I look forward to gain my maximum through this class.
